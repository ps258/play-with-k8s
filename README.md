# play-with-k8s

This is a fork of [Play with docker](https://github.com/play-with-docker/play-with-docker) which attempts to make it easy to get up and running with a local implementation of [Play with k8s](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)

### Requirements

* I've only been able to get it running on CentOS 7. In other envs the initial kubeadm command fails because it cannot communicate with the kubelet

### Support, liability, usability, fitness for any purpose

Absolutely none.
